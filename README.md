# Facebook Album Downloader

A script to download an facebook album. 
Facebook already has an option to donwload the entire album but you must be the owner of the album and sometimes it fails to download albums with to many pictures. 
Using this script you'll be able download the album without being the owner of it.

Must change the 'ALBUM_URL' (in 'do_scrapping' function) to the album url you want to download.
Install all dependencies and run it 
"python3 file.py" on terminal

Just a Python's beginner project...
Still in development... (I'll probably never come back here though xD)
